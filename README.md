# SDN-Controller-filling-flowtable-entries
<pre>
Required project to complete advance computer networks course in BITS Pilani KK Birla Goa Campus. 
In this project I tried to block some specific flows while keeping others in mininet-WIFI. So its kind of a firewall in SDN network.

Steps to run:
1> Run topology file using mininet
2> Execute python file 
3> Try to ping stations
4> Some stations will be able to ping some specific stations as per the firewall.
